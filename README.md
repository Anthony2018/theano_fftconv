Convolution op for Theano based on CuFFT using scikits.cuda

This is an experiment in implementing an FFT-based convolution op for Theano, using scikits.cuda. It was inspired by this paper, which shows promising speedups for FFT-based convolutions in the Torch7 framework: http://openreview.net/document/aa6ab717-ca19-47e1-a958-823b9a106ca9

Currently this is barely functional and not very fast. Input is welcome!
